# Member Protocol

Onchain membership based experience

## Deployment

Install terrain globally then run this to generate the wasm bytecode.

```sh
terrain task:run build_and_optimize
```

NOTE: Please use [celatone](https://terra.celat.one) or write your own script with feather.js to store code and instantiate contract. Terrain is broken (or my setup is wrong) on signing tx.
